opinion previously my favorite expansion was burning crusade',\n"," 'good game bought this for my son for his birthday and he liked it lot he definitely recommends this game to anybody who play command and conquer style games',\n"," 'stunningly beatiful but this game lacks one major partweather this game has zero weather change it stays daytime 247 zero cycles zero rain overcast evening storms etc nothing but bright sunny day this adds nothing to the atmosphere of the game found this out the hard way the only way the weather changes is if you encounter the orbs talking to each other done poorly voice acting its da shame when almost the only thing that this game counts on fails to do that wanted to love this game it is breathtaking in scenery and at times surreal and draws you in but there is no dynamic weather so got refund was not worth 1999 thank you',\n"," 'five stars daughter addicted to game',\n"," 'awesome game couldnt stop playing it fight night champion is the best graphically made game of the century it delivers an amazing experience of boxing once you start playing it you cannot stop this game was made in 2011 and it is still the best sports game in terms of graphics not even new sports game like nba 2k14 could match these graphics in my opinion now to the gameplay itself an electrifying experience playing the game whether youre playing mike tyson vs muhammad ali or manny pacquiao vs miguel cotto first you can easily see that mike tyson doesnt fight like lennox lewis and roy jones jr doesnt fight like bernard hopkins in this game mike tyson style is landing power punches and blocking most of your punches not really step forward in his fighting style than in previous fight night games lennox lewis uses his jab to set himself up and then either uses the hook or the uppercut to finish the combination roy jones jr uses his boxing iq to leave you on the canvas using powerful uppercuts crosses jabs and most importantly hooks bernard hopkins also uses his iq to leave you on the canvas with fierce combinations and blocking ability wladimir klitschko and vitali klitschko use their height mostly with using jabs to face and upper body and hooks to the head on the ropes they dont aim to the body as much in this game manny pacquiao uses his speed to trade with you and he forces you to fight back leaving your face andor body open and then he knocks you down muhammad ali clearly likes to wear you down for the first couple of rounds and then attack but be careful of butterbean underestimated him and just fired away at his body and head without using any defense at all and just thought that ill knock him out and hurt him easily nope thats exactly what didnt happen he just floored me with rocket rpg right hand like didnt even touch him and got seriously hurt and was out what was that all about one punch knockout in the first round so he was acting like julio cesar chavez vs meldrick taylor but all in the first round why ea even if you lower all of his stats in edit boxer mode he still destroys you like nothing guess its because changed his red everlast gloves to black everlast gloves also known as the knockout gloves that sergio martinez wears back to features if you get knocked twice in single round you cant get up even if you reach the green bar and you start pushing up the right stick and you think youre fine on that second knockdown youre not fine thought that juan manuel marquez vs pacquiao in their first fight got up from three knockdowns in one round could you also fix this ea because it is possible to get up from 2 knockdowns in real boxing fight why not fight night but in terms of price this game is more than worth 1999 much more than that so thanks so much for making this game ea you never cease to amaze us with ncaa football 14 madden 13 and 25 fifa 13 and 14 battlefield 3 and 4 nhl 13 and 14 possibly nba live 14 fight night champion of course ncaa basketball series grand slam tennis ufc series ea sports mma knockout kings but wow ea sports with all their games have put me in the game once again the best graphics of the decade and definitely 2011 but just think about it this game is revolutionary because this game was made in 2011 where nba 2k11 was made sorry about the comparison of boxing and basketball but just had to do it to show how important the graphics are in this game and nba 2k11s graphics were nothing close to what this is and people said that that was revolutionary but it wasnt revoultionary in the history of sports games of course it was great in the basketball video game history and to 2k sports but this game is revolutionary in the history of games because of the graphics this was made in 2011 and had such amazing graphics and the superb gameplay and right nows the best time to order it from amazon because of the very low price of 1999 beacause it is worth much more than it costs right now but buy it right now you wont be dissapointed update okay now after couple days and much more playing ive started thinking about the little things and could be improved in the game like dont you want more coverage of fights like having teddy atlas doing his fight plan for either boxer before the fight starts more detailed tale of the tape where the commentators actually talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each fighter more sponsors not like fight night round 3 where it had way too many commercials and sponsors but realistic sponsors like for friday night fights the broadcasting service than fight night champion is imitating such as tecate and just for men haircolor possibly you could bring back foot locker but put the commercials in there as well or if ea sports is extremely desperate for commercial just say sponsered by ea sports its in the game maybe ea sports could also add fighter introductions like how it is in ufc undisputed 3 in the next fight night round 6 or fight night champion 2 or whatever the next fight night game will be named possibly some better and more detailed trainer feedback in the next game like also in ufc undisputed 3 and how about add different broadcasting services like in ncaa basketball 10 so we could choose if we want hbo showtime espn andor nbc sports to broadcast our fight and to have different commentators each broadcasting service like for hbo we could have jim lampley and max kellerman or roy jones jr as their commentators for showtime we can have al bernstein jim gray and paulie malignaggi for espn we could have the same commentators in the current fight night champion game could also be nice if we could have some sideline reporting in the game like doris burke in nba
